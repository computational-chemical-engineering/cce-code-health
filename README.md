# cce-code-health

> **Experimental (0.x).** Interfaces, file layouts and scores may change without notice.

Code-health tooling for the computational-chemical-engineering repositories:

- a measuring tool (`codehealth`) that scores Python and C++ code for the properties that
  make code hard to change (complexity, nesting, size, duplication, cohesion) and ranks
  hotspots by combining those scores with git history;
- a CI gate that blocks changes that make code worse (a ratchet, not an absolute bar);
- a Claude Code plugin with a behaviour-preserving **refactor loop** that improves code
  health step by step and builds up a per-repository **playbook**, which ordinary coding
  agents then follow as their coding standard.

Inspired by Adam Tornhill's work on code health and hotspots. The scores here are an
open-source proxy, not CodeScene's Code Health metric.
